-----VIKING------
=================

Codename Viking game project. Work in progress by UVic GameDev club.

=================
----TODO LIST----
=================

See TODO file in repository root folder

Build Dependencies
=================

Building this project requires:

	1) The Irrlicht rendering engine.
		The library files for Irrlicht must be in your path.
		The include files for irrlicht must be accessible as <irrlicht/Irrlicht.h>
		I recommend downloading the latest version of Irrlicht from their SVN repository.
		Follow the instructions here to set it up: http://irrlicht3d.org/wiki/index.php?n=Main.InstallingIrrlicht

	2) Scons software construction tool 
		On ubuntu, download it with "sudo apt-get install scons"
		otherwise: http://www.scons.org/

	3) C++ compiler with good C++11 support (g++ recommended)
		I think Scons somehow detects which compiler you should use?

	4) You should have python installed whether or not you decide to build this project. Python is just awesome.

	5) Maybe boost will eventually be used.

=================
Naming Convention (work in progress)
=================

Types and functions:
	class/struct naming: UpperCase

	primitive typedefs (u32, s32): lowercase

	function: camelCase

	member variables: camelCase

Files:
	One class per file

	Files have the same name as class, including capitalization.

	Headers use .hpp extension rather than .h

	Source files use .cpp extension rather than .cc or .c++

	header guards for MyClass.hpp:
		#ifndef MYCLASS_HPP_INCLUDED
		#define MYCLASS_HPP_INCLUDED
		#endif // MYCLASS_HPP_INCLUDED

	namespace for all code in project:
		namespace vik
		{
		NOTE: no indentation inside the namespace
		} // end namespace vik

If you are not sure about an element of naming conventions,
Either look for something similar already done in the code base OR
ask Nicolas so he can tell you he doesn't care as long as it's sensitive and consistent.
