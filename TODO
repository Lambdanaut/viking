Developer: Nicolas
	Quests:
	-Make HashedStrings store passed in string in a 128 byte buffer in debug builds rather than storing a reference
	-Write good test cases for HashedString

	-Think of a smart way to do linking for the test cases
	-Possibly think of smarter way to do tests in general
	-Perhaps a Test build which just runs a bunch of stuff?

	-'''CONSIDER''' making EventSource store listeners as a set (worried about double adding/double removing)
	-Document lifetimes and shared ownership better between game object factories engines and game objects themselves
	-Document dependencies of project better (Irrlicht, SCons, C++11...)
	-Implement Actor input for Player derivative
	-Implement Actor visuals
	

Future quest ideas:
Island survival theme
Drop in drop out 4 player
Ambient soundtrack
Build character/buildings
